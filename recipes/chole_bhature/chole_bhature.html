    <h1>About Chole Bhature</h1>
        <p>

            Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry.
            
            In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.
            
            This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chana curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a comforting taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.
            
            Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and chewy.
            
            I usually make the Bhatura Recipe that is already posted on the blog and it works for me every-time together with this quick bhatura vesion that I have shared below.
            
            As a side with the dish serve sliced onions, green chilies and lemon wedges. This a very filling dish and you might feel like having a short nap after eating it. Ideal for weekends or holiday time.
            
            The delicious chickpea curry can be also had with poori, Naan or Kulcha or Aloo Kulcha or Aloo Paratha. They taste equally good with bread or pav (dinner rolls).</p>

        <p>The chickpeas have to be cooked really well. They should not be just cooked or al dente, the way they are served in many restaurants.

                They should be soft when cooked and melt in your mouth. However, care should be taken that they should not be overcooked or become mushy.</p>

    <h1>Method:-</h1>
    <h2>Soak and pressure chickpeas</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours. <br>
            <img src="/recipes/chole_bhature/img/step1.webp" alt="photo of chickpeas" height="300px">
        </li>
        <li>Next day they will double in size. <br>
            <img src="/recipes/chole_bhature/img/step2.webp" alt="photo of chickpeas getting double in size" height="300px">
        </li>
        <li>Then drain the water. <br>
            <img src="/recipes/chole_bhature/img/step3.webp" alt="" height="300px">
        </li>
        <li>In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan.

            The chickpeas will take a lesser time to cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot.
            
            You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional. <br>
        <img src="/recipes/chole_bhature/img/step4.webp" alt="" height="300px">
        </li>
        <li>Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender and cooked well.

            Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and have a melt in the mouth texture.
            
            If cooking them in a pan then it can take about an hour or more. Just ensure they are well cooked. Timing to cook chickpeas will depend upon their quality and age. <br>
        <img src="/recipes/chole_bhature/img/step5.webp" alt="" height="300px">
        </li>
        <li>Once done then drain all the water and keep the cooked chickpeas aside. <br>
